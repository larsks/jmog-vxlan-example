This is a simulation of [this network topology](https://serverfault.com/q/1164956/27515) using [Kathara](https://www.kathara.org/). To use it:

1. Install Kathara.
1. Run `kathara lstart` to create the test environment.
1. Run `kathara connect <hostname>` to connect to a virtual host (`server1`, `server2`, `lan1host1`, `lan2host1`)
1. Run `kathara lclean` to clean things up.
